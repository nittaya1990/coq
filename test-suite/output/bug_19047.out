The command has indeed failed with message:
Recursive definition of F is ill-formed.
In environment
coacc_rect :
  forall (A : Type) (R : A -> A -> Prop) (P : A -> Type),
  (forall x : A,
   (forall y : A, R x y -> coAcc R y) -> (forall y : A, R x y -> P y) -> P x) ->

  (forall y : A, R x y -> coAcc R y) -> (forall y : A, R x y -> P y) -> P x
F : forall x : A, coAcc R x -> P x
x : R
a : coAcc P x
The codomain is "f x"
which should be a coinductive type.
Recursive definition is:
"fun (x : A) (a : coAcc R x) =>
 match a with
 | coAcc_intro _ _ g => f x g (fun (y : A) (r : R x y) => F y (g y r))
 end".
